# 🚗 Smart-Parking-Lot
Smart-Parking-Lot System using ARDUINO UNO board

🚗 An interactive Smart Parking Lot system using Arduino Uno, built to detect vehicle presence, manage gate access, track parking duration, and calculate payment — all with a touch screen interface and real-time clock.

## 🧠 How does it work? 

### System Initialization – Sets all parking spots to free, LEDs turn green.

### 🚘 Vehicle Detection – Ultrasonic sensor opens the gate automatically when a car approaches and there's space.

🅿️ Parking Spot Monitoring – Light sensors detect if a car is parked.

LED turns red when occupied.

Entry time is stored.

### 💸 Exit & Payment – When a car leaves:

LED turns green

Time is calculated

Price is shown based on duration

Touchscreen UI – Displays status, buttons for actions, and payment info.

RTC Module – Accurate tracking of parking durations.

### At End of day: Total profit shown when parking is closed

## 🔧 Components Used
Arduino Uno

LDR sensors (for spot detection)

Ultrasonic sensor (for gate trigger)

Servo motor (gate control)

RTC DS1307 (Real Time Clock)

TFT Touchscreen (ILI9341)

RGB LEDs (Red/Green per parking spot)
